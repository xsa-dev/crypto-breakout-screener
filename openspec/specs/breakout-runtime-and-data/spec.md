# breakout-runtime-and-data Specification

## Purpose
Define the safe runtime modes, canonical market-data contracts, provider boundaries, normalization rules, and no-lookahead invariants used by the breakout strategy.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Operation modes are explicit and staged
The system SHALL implement typed local configuration for `advisory_only`, `semi_auto`, and `full_auto` operation modes while keeping live `full_auto` execution blocked by deferred-scope gates until a later approved execution change. The system SHALL allow historical backtest, paper trading, reduced-risk pilot, and production stages to be configured separately.

#### Scenario: Baseline mode is safe
- **WHEN** the baseline breakout configuration is loaded during this foundation slice
- **THEN** the operation mode defaults to `semi_auto`
- **AND** no broker order can be submitted by foundation components

#### Scenario: Advisory-only mode
- **WHEN** a breakout setup is detected in `advisory_only` mode
- **THEN** the system records the signal and decision trace
- **AND** the system does not submit broker orders

#### Scenario: Semi-auto mode
- **WHEN** a risk-approved trade intent is produced in `semi_auto` mode
- **THEN** the system requires operator confirmation before execution

#### Scenario: Full-auto mode remains gated
- **WHEN** a risk-approved trade intent is produced in `full_auto` mode before the deferred execution change is approved
- **THEN** the system rejects live broker execution through the deferred-scope gate
- **AND** the system records the blocked automated execution decision

### Requirement: Market and timeframe scope is configurable
The system SHALL support configurable symbols and markets including forex, crypto, futures, CFD, stocks, and equivalent broker/API instruments when valid data and execution adapters exist. The baseline strategy SHALL support M15 execution context and H1/H4/D1 higher-timeframe context.

#### Scenario: Baseline timeframes configured
- **WHEN** the baseline configuration is loaded
- **THEN** the execution timeframe includes `M15`
- **AND** context timeframes include `H1`, `H4`, and `D1`

#### Scenario: Unsupported instrument
- **WHEN** a symbol has no compatible market-data provider or broker adapter
- **THEN** the system rejects that symbol with a configuration error before trading

### Requirement: Market data providers expose bars, ticks, and optional order book
The system SHALL expose local provider protocols/interfaces for historical bars, recent or streaming ticks, and optional order-book/density data using canonical DTOs that can be implemented by fakes in tests before any live adapter is approved. Missing optional order book data SHALL NOT break core breakout detection but SHALL be reflected in density scoring.

#### Scenario: Fake provider is sufficient for tests
- **WHEN** foundation tests evaluate breakout levels or setup scores
- **THEN** they can use an in-memory provider without network credentials
- **AND** the provider returns canonical bars/ticks accepted by the normalizer

#### Scenario: Bars are fetched
- **WHEN** historical analysis or backtest requests bars
- **THEN** the provider returns canonical OHLCV bars with timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume, spread/source metadata when available

#### Scenario: Ticks are fetched
- **WHEN** realtime breakout confirmation requires tick data
- **THEN** the provider returns canonical ticks with timestamp, bid, ask, last, volume/flags when available

#### Scenario: Order book is unavailable
- **WHEN** density scoring is requested and no order book source is configured
- **THEN** the system records density as unavailable or uses an approved configured proxy

### Requirement: Data normalization prevents inconsistent inputs
The normalizer SHALL implement UTC conversion, deterministic deduplication, ordering validation, configured resampling/gap marking, and metadata propagation for canonical bars and ticks.

#### Scenario: Out-of-order input is normalized or rejected
- **WHEN** provider data arrives out of timestamp order
- **THEN** the normalizer emits deterministic ordered events or raises an explicit validation error according to configuration

#### Scenario: Duplicate event received
- **WHEN** a duplicate bar or tick arrives from a provider
- **THEN** the normalizer emits one canonical event or updates it idempotently according to configured source precedence

#### Scenario: Feed gap detected
- **WHEN** expected bars or ticks are missing beyond the configured tolerance
- **THEN** the system records a feed-gap event
- **AND** live execution is blocked or degraded according to operations policy

### Requirement: No-lookahead invariant is enforced
The foundation implementation SHALL include tests proving online calculations do not use future bars, future ticks, or unconfirmed pivot right-window bars. The system MUST NOT use future bars, future ticks, or unconfirmed right-window pivots when producing online signals, risk decisions, or live orders.

#### Scenario: Closed-bar-only signal calculation is tested
- **WHEN** an online setup is evaluated at a historical bar
- **THEN** tests verify only closed bars available at that timestamp are passed to level and setup calculations

#### Scenario: Pivot requires right-window bars
- **WHEN** a pivot candidate depends on `pivot_right_bars=3`
- **THEN** the pivot becomes valid only after three later bars have closed

#### Scenario: Backtest uses same online information boundary
- **WHEN** a backtest evaluates a bar
- **THEN** the strategy only sees data that would have been available at that historical time
